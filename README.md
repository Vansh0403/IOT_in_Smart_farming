# IOT_in_Smart_farming
It applies to Internet Of Things. The project was first presented as the exploratory project in Btech sem 4. The basic use was to make the farming system smart and more advanced. 
The circuit was designed on the proteus software and later on implemented on hardware also. Blynk server was used to make it automated and VSPE was used to develop com ports and also the serial redirector. It basically gives the user a dashboard on their mobile phones to control and switch on the motor pump when the humidity indicated by the soil moisture is below a certain threshold.Also their is a motion sensor PIR sensor to sense any tresspassing and display the same on the phone.Also a DHT11 sensor continuously senses the environment's weather and tempertaure conditions.
